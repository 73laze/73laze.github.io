            <p> A book like no other (and even better, a very short one) - it completely encapsulates and gives voice to my thoughts and feelings about the status quo. One of my favorite excerpts, an observation on students in college: </p>

            <p> “Many of the teenage students I encountered seemed to be in a state of what I would call ‘Depressive Hedonia’. Depression is usually characterized as a state of anhedonia, but the condition I’m referring to is constituted not by an inability to get pleasure so much as it by and inability to do anything else EXCEPT pursue pleasure. There is a sense that something is missing - but no appreciation that this mysterious, missing enjoyment can only be accessed BEYOND the pleasure principle. In large part this is a consequence of students ambiguous structural position, stranded between their old role as subjects of disciplinary institutions and their new status as consumers of services.” </p>
