            <p> Felt as if I sat at an old mans campfire and he told me a great story, meant for me alone. He talked and talked and I kept adding wood to the fire, never letting it extinguish. I needed to know what happened next, despite hearing the story so many times. </p>

            <p> Last time I read this was in High School! I never paid much attention to the prose, and I honestly did not care much for the songs. I thought they were stupid then. “Who cares about songs in a fantasy book?? Give me action!!!” Now, almost 10 years later, I love them! He’s a natural poet. I found myself slowly singing along, and fully appreciating how much charm and wonder they add. </p>

            <p> His prose is so pleasant, descriptive, rhythmic, and simple. I often wish I could be forced to adventure somewhere, to sit in the wild and miss home and an armchair, but simultaneously enjoy the memories I’m making. We all have a little of Bilbo inside of us, is what this story told me. I can’t wait to read this book again, and again. And again! </p>
