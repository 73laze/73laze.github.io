            <p> If you are a fan of Atwoods work, you'll find more to love here if you love poetry! There were atleast 13 poems in this collection that really struck me, and to me that's well worth the price of the book. I am sure with repeated reads, I'll come to love even more of them. </p>

            <p> Ill share my favorite one below. </p>

            <p> Title of Poem: Within </p>

            <ul>
                <li> Outside we see a shriveling, </li>
                <li> but from within, as felt </li>
                <li> by heart and breath and inner skin, how different, </li>
                <li> how vast how calm how part of everything </li>
                <li> how starry dark. Last breath. Divine </li>
                <li> perhaps. Perhaps relief. The lovers caught </li>
                <li> and sealed inside a cavern, </li>
                <li> voices raised in one last hovering </li>
                <li> duet, until the small wax light </li>
                <li> goes out. Well anyway </li>
                <li> I held your hand and maybe </li>
                <li> you held mine </li>
                <li> as the stone or universe closed in </li>
                <li> around you. </li>
                <li> Though not me. I'm still outside. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </body>
