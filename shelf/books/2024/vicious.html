            <p> I think as long as you suspend disbelief, the story can be enjoyed at an extremely fast pace. But stopping to squint your eyes at anything between the words on the page and you’ll wonder how it even all works together. I found it to be an ok book. I think it would work better as a graphic novel. </p>
