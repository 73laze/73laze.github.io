            <p> wish he wasn’t so god damn misogynistic. As a concept, the idea of the story - and the writing and visceral horror that flows out of the words keeps me coming back and thinking about the piece. But he writes women like a fucking caveman. It pulls you out so quick and ultimately damages his work and I think that’s a great shame. </p>
