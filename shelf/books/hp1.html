            <p> First foray into the origin of she-who-must-not-be named behemoth franchise. I haven’t ever read this series before, but have seen the movies. Despite knowing the author is a TERF and ignorant af, I wanna give the books an honest shot. </p>

            <p> I loved sorcerers stone, having watched that movie time and time again - so I was excited to dive into this.</p>

            <p> It’s a very simple book. It’s written in a very juvenile way, but that’s the point for sure. I found myself hooked to the story and enjoying myself despite the shallow prose. I wish I allowed myself to read this as a kid tbh. I liked it for what it was! Onto the next. </p>
