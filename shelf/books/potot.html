            <p> *spoiler alert** Landing on a 3 for now - may bump it up later as I process. I enjoyed this book but didn't fall in love with it. I can definitely see the appeal tho and it's no wonder people love it. I just didnt jive that much with the authors writing style. </p>

            <p> Despite my inexperience with high fantasy novels this one was mostly enjoyable from beginning to end. It starts pretty slow, but as it builds itself up it picks up speed and takes off. It finds a satisfying momentum. I enjoyed the characters arcs and development even though in the end, it feels very rushed to wrap things up. The author plays out this story expertly like a chess player setting up her pieces and then as the story unfolds, they are knocked down - with some surprise pieces deployed along the way. Overall, I found it satisfying. </p>

            <p> Ead and Sabran are fuckin cute together. Very good job writing this romance!!! Ead was my favorite character by far.</p>

            <p> the final battle of the abyss. 2 chapters. it was epic but really had me like "THATS IT?? JUST LIKE THAT??" I listened to "find the flame" and "to sail forbidden seas" by Masayoshi Soken from the ff16 OST during those chapters. Very fitting highly rec you re read it with these pieces max volume. </p>

            <p> It may speak to the cynicism within me, but all the loose ends and character arcs wind up in such happy endings. It tends to pull me out based on my worldview, because i believe people in this time period would not be so understanding and positive to change things - but maybe thats the point of the story. Leaders and nations are overcoming centuries of prejudices and misconceptions - and on an individual level you have people coming to terms with their own pains / pasts and growing from it. Idk, maybe thats something i need to reflect on myself. Change has to start somewhere right? and it does - this world intends to change for the better after the defeat of the nameless one. </p>

            <p> “Perhaps you should ask yourself a different question, honored Miduchi,” he said. “Would the world be any better if we were all the same?” The door closed behind him. Tané reflected on his words and realized that she had no answer.</p>
