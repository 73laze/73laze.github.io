            <p> I cant tell if the book is a prank, a thought experiment, or just straight up military masturbation. Maybe all 3. I found the arguments and questions about a society run by veterans interesting at times, even though I completely disagree with it. I don't think it works at all but makes sense he would write this given the time period he lived in. </p>

            <p> The writing just completely turned me off. Story was pretty thin, and boring. VERY boring. A snoozefest until you get to the lectures, which is ironic considering a lecture in real life would have a higher likely hood of making me fall asleep? The 2 stars are for the ideas presented and the fun I had chewing on them but theres really nothing else i got from this book. Its mostly just the author presenting his ideas in a ham fisted fashion, beating you over the head with it. In between that you got some military jargon that most (unless you've served yourself probly) will find incessant and pedantic. The lectures are the only meat to bite into in this novel. Other then that, literally nothing happens. If I have to read it again, i might buy the farm. Ill stick to reddit and YT videos if i wanna dive into his ideas presented here. This book can hardly be called SCIFI (IMO) </p>
