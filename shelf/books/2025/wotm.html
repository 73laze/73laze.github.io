            <p> **spoiler alert** My favorite exchange in this book:</p>

            <p> “….we will wait for the right moment, wait until the Hierarchy is ready to crumble, and then strike. Remove our oppressors. Start again.” </p>

            <p> My fists clench. It’s the answer I expected. </p>

            <p> “That’s the problem with people, though, isn’t it? They always think that other people are the problem.” Quiet. Angry. “You want to remove the princeps? The senators? You’ll just become them sooner or later. If all you’re trying to change who is in control, then you don’t really want to change anything.” </p>
