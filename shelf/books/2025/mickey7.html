            <p> **spoiler alert** I like this book first and foremost. I think is a good read - I think it could’ve been shorter, maybe? I love the philosophical questions presented about “immortality” through cloning your body and mind. It doesn’t aim to answer them, and that’s okay, or atleast it’s okay with me. Look, Lost was my favorite show for like a decade if that makes sense. Iykyk. </p> 

            <p> The quantum physics commentary is cool at times, especially when describing the “bullet” and that whole flashback. But it is just the author speaking at that point through Mickey. Mickey is a historian but it seems laymen know at least a bit of basic quantum physics in this universe. The more we got of that the more it kinda took me out but hey, that’s just me. Some people love that type of stuff. </p>

            <p> I didn’t love how many flashbacks there were to the failed colonies. Maybe I was just looking for a faster paced novel? These segments are used, I think, to kinda slow it down a bit. But near the end it kind of feels like padding. I think it was propped up so Mickey could use his lessons as a historian, and thus the history of colonization failures on hospitable planets and their aggression towards the native aliens there - to do something different this time around. </p>

            <p> It’s ironic but also poignant for our times, that he being a historian in a time when there’s no “use for one” because everyone has access to all of history all the time - that he finds his use to broker peace between humans and aliens. To find the points of failure in history and use that to make a better decision. To me, that’s the strongest point of this book and what speaks to me the most. You know what. Typing this out maybe I do kinda like the historical flashbacks. History isn’t always fun but the lessons told are immortal…just as long as someone listens. </p>
