            <p> “In your whole life nobody has ever abused you more than you have abused yourself. And the limit of your self-abuse is exactly the limit that you will tolerate from someone else”. </p>

            <p> Many, many times I closed this book and just sat with what I just read. Lots of things in here that are actually life / perspective changing. Highly recommend. Will be living the four agreements for the rest of my days. </p>

            <p> let it be known: i have a strong disdain for organized religion and rigid belief systems - this is not that. there is some talk of a god(s) in here but you can still extract the messages in here and it have the same level of effect. </p>

            <p> I got this for like, 4 bucks at a FIVE BELOW. MAYBE less. What a fantastic purchase. </p>
