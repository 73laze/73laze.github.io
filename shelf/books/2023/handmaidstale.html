            <p> I am not sure what else I can say about this book that hasn't already been said, but I really, really enjoyed this book. A truly necessary book. America has changed in the past decade and the world this book portrays could be on the horizon.

            <p> My favorite thing about this book was the writing itself. It was rough, and simple to start - but this was intended by the writer since the perspective we get is limited in a way. Her thoughts are quick and come at bursts. At times she also daydreams and escapes into echoes of the past to escape reality - all of which were beautifully written and break up the rigidness. I felt claustrophobic and downtrodden in Offreds mind. Dissociating and reciting the litanies with her as I went through the book. By the end, I felt like these bitch ass dusty disgusting men turning these women into vessels just might be their undoing. I hope to find out I'm right by the time I read the next book! </p>
