            <p> **spoiler alert** Originally rated it 2 stars but brought it down to 1. The more I sit and chew on what I just read, the more I tend to dislike the book. </p>

            <p> The biggest problem I have with this book is that it presents complex ideas and themes like real life vs virtual reality, online relationships, and obsession - and does nothing with them. ALL the puzzle pieces are there, but Ernest does not connect them. Instead we get this shallow book that says nothing but Wade is an insufferable MC, and doesn't learn or care about anything other then the contest. He has a goofy lil forced romance with Artemis but it comes off as creepy more than anything else. </p>

            <p> What I wish I could change: </p>

            <p> The Aech reveal was wasted and weird. It felt like the author was patting himself on the back (Aechs’ quote about the power and privilege white males have, thus hiding behind a white male avatar). Instead of boosting up yourself on this part, this could have been a great chance to give the story a great twist it desperately needed. Aech = H. Aech has an entire basement chatroom in honor of Halliday. Aech is also one of the top Gunters, way above Wade socially, but considers only HIM an equal to his 80s knowledge and video game skills. While cliche, bringing back Halliday from the dead to reveal Aech is really him wouldnt have been a bad idea! </p>

            <p> With a reveal like this, Wade could finally look himself in the mirror and see who hes become. Halliday could turn out to be a pathetic, jaded old gamer who is just bored and mad he didnt get the love of his life. The connection between reality and virtual could not have been more broken here, and lessons learned. That would have been more interesting. It would also make the blurb saying "willy wonka meets the matrix" on the front of the book make SENSE! Of course, just adding that wouldn’t fix the entire book, but it least would’ve been something - anything to grasp onto in this novel. </p>

            <p> I do thank this book for showing me what I dont like in science fiction. This aint it folks. </p>
