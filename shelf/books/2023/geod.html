            <p> My absolute favorite Dune book in the series. It's like you are reading a journal / diary from a mad god who knows everything and anything that happened throughout all of time. This book completely changed my world view, in a way. One of his many philosophical rants that I enjoyed was on religious power bases and the danger of religion in politics - insanely on point. I felt as this entire book was Frank Herbert pouring his soul out onto a page, all his studies and musings in one place. A very intimate read with the author. I loved it all, even though it was quite crazy. I can't wait to read it again</p>
