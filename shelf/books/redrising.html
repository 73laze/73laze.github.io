            <p> I would have probably ate this shit up back in high school, when I was oblivious to my future and what I suffer now. This book aims to entertain you, but I couldn’t shake the feeling I was being sold a fantasy out of my own suffering and hopes - late stage capitalism; Americas boot on my neck 5 days a week. </p>

            <p> The communist iconography and symbolism is impossible to avoid: The bottom class are called “reds”. A sling blade being chosen as Darrows symbol to his meteoric rise against the bourgeois class of “golds”. This book invites you to escape and fantasize about rising up. Usually I can fuck with that if it wasn’t so escapist in nature. IMO it just leaves a sour taste in my mouth. I get that’s maybe exclusive to me, but hey. That’s how I felt when I read it! In summary, this book just reminds me of how anti capitalism really is just capitalism. </p>

            <p> Anyways, Darrow drinks some serious dumb bitch juice. Didn’t like any of the characters besides sevro and mustang, and the middle section especially was a massive slog to get past. The story didn’t really start getting good until the last quarter so kudos to that I suppose. He can write action sequences well. Everything in between those parts sucks. I found a great portion of the twists to be predictable and not all that surprising. </p>
