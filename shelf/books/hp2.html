            <p> A lot more going on in this one compared to sorcerer’s stone. My favorite part being the quidditch game (written a LOT better in this book than the last) and the ending twist. Wish I could’ve erased the movie from my brain so I could enjoy this book more lol. The story is engaging as hell and it’s a simple page turner. Loving Ron’s character compared to the movies depiction. Onto the next! </p>
