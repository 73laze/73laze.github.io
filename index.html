            <p>  [12.04.25] // happy metroid prime 4 day!!! totally not screamin and crying internally. I cant afford it. Im still going through prime 3 anyways lol. </p>
            <p>  [12.03.25] // added music to the site in the most basic way possible by using the audio controls HTML tag. inspired by visiting a website of a close friend of mine and realized how much it can really...add. brinstar red soil is the definite fuckin vibe. :] </p>
            <p>  [11.30.25] // new logo is live! just have to fix it on all the other pages now. Logo creation is courtesy of <a href="https://www.flamingtext.com/"> flamingtext.com! really fuckin cool website. </a>
            <p>  [11.30.25] // domain is live : - D </p>
            <p>  [11.30.25] // happy fucksgivles! its been a week or so. My life has been incredibly hectic. I moved back to Georgia in maybe the most chaotic way possible but its done. Back to learning some webdev! </p>
            <p>  [11.21.25] // domain change imminent! https://73laze.online will be the new domain soon (hopefully)
            <p>  [11.21.25] // DINNER TIME - DINNER IN AMERICAAAAAAAAAA. </p>
            <p>  [11.20.25] // back on arch, btw. been back tbh just havent released an update about it. bit the bullet and learned how to navigate the config files (mostly). using someone elses minimial waybar setup. </p>
            <p>  [11.18.25] // game logs are up. links properly work. Ill be adding to the logs overtime if I think of something I maybe didnt mention. Metroid Prime 2 echoes log will be quite long so just bare with me as its not really complete yet. I have a lot to say about that game lol. </p>
            <p>  [11.17.25] // 73laze is just Blaze but with "leet" like language to shape the "B". Not sure why but through the years ive always found it aesthetically pleasing to find different ways to shape letters with numbers. Like "72" kind of looks like R. Or L7 looks like a brutalist D or something. I found it unlocks username capabilities with names that are usually taken. For instance, Blaze was the first ever tag I gave myself at the age of 6, playing Halo 1 on the xbox. Ive never been able to use that tag though, because its always taken. So it has some sentimental value to me. </p>
            <p>  [11.16.25] // website name change, this is normal a.d.d. behavior so dont get used to a name lol. </p>
            <p>  [11.14.25] // I may be addicted to cleaning up my digital footprint lol </p>
            <p>  [11.12.25] // fuck the spider guardian in mp2. what the hell is this. </p>
            <p>  [11.07.25] // im not trying to, but it seems 1 o clock is always the time I release some kind of status update lol. finally fixed the text alignment of the p tags here on this page. when I was trying to fix it I thought I had to change the css in my .home container, but nah. was thinking too hard about it. simple fix. </p>
            <p>  [11.06.15] // played metroid prime 2 echoes for 7 hours straight yesterday. holy shit. cant even remember the last time I did that. this game is so good. </p>
            <p>  [11.05.25] // long time no update. Mamdani won NY, lets fucking go. I put windows back on my Legion S7 15ach6. Its complete trash but I do love that games typically work out of the box without much tinkering - and thats all that thing will be doing. There wont be much data for microsoft to scrape. Im going to keep tinkering with it to see just how secure I can make it. I fucked up my cachyOS hyprland configs by installing some other dudes dotfiles. I wasnt skilled enough to go back to default, so upon doing a fresh cachyOS install I learned that they just deprecated their hyprland support. I am now rocking linux mint on my thinkpad and I gotta say - its fuckin smooth. apt is nowhere near as fast as pacman, and im gonna miss the AUR, but I do love having a stable distro that I know I wont have to spend hours configuring with. Ill be back on arch one day. I just dont have the time or the skill set to make tinkering a sustainable hobby right now - atleast on that level. </p>
            <p>  [10.28.25] // my thinkpad t14 gen 1 arrived today, and I gotta say - the keyboard is one of the best ive ever felt. immediately put cachyOS on it. this is so much better than carrying around my humongo gaming laptop. also better battery. </p>
            <p>  [10.26.25] // halo: campaign evolved stands to be a cheap reflection of todays fps genre and nothing more. how depressing. </p>
            <p>  [10.23.25] // 3 updates in one day?? crazy. had an idea that I might move status updates into its own dedicated html page, and then in its place putting a "chat board" where people can write things on the website. like say hi or whatever. </p>
            <p>  [10.23.25] // fixed all the broken links and srcs caused by the transition from publishing from /docs to /root. the repo looks saur gaurd now. </p>
            <p>  [10.23.25] // finally cleaned up the directories for the website. I want to actually produce content on this site, but I also want to keep improving its functionality lol. Both are equally time consuming. </p>
            <p>  [10.22.25] // started playing silent hill 2 remake last night since its free on ps plus extra. I dont normally pay that subscription but I wanna finish death stranding - which is also locked behind that sub lol. let the spooky game playing commence.</p>
            <p>  [10.20.25] // the neighbor above me may just be a giant heel. </p>
            <p>  [10.17.15] // first post is up on the posts page: "photos from a faraway world." Check it out :]</p>
            <p>  [10.17.25] // had a tooth filling fall out Wednesday afternoon. My mouth has to be worth 4k at this point with the amount of fillings in my mouth. Add another 1k on that for repair, another filling and a cleaning. Are we great again yet? </p>
            <p>  [10.15.25] // explored central park zoo yesterday, and then had some godly, immaculate ramen in midtown new york. snagged some great pictures that ill put up soon as a post. </p>
            <p>  [10.13.25] // have completely overhauled the websites homepage to go into a more minimal direction. quite pleased with out it came out. </p>
            <p>  [10.13.25] // deciding to add a static status page to my websites landing page. wanted to use status cafe, but wanted to opt for something simpler.</p>
