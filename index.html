                    <li> [12.11.25] 4 hours of basic html course work today over on freecodecamp.org and immediately put it to use. 2 biggest things i learned was the existence of section elements and id attributes. a bit confusing when you toss in div elements in there too. target box and devlog are the results of todays learnings. logging off, status box will be back up tomorrow. </li>
                    <li> [12.10.25] the website is like mostly broken. its 2am. i need to go to bed. </li> 
                    <li> [12.06.25] finally using some div tags : > ] learning their use came organically. i wanted to edit the li elements below the nav bar but not above, so i needed to find a way to separate elements into their own containers. avoila - za div tag. </li>
                    <li> [11.30.25] domain is live : - D </li>
                    <li> [11.21.25] domain change imminent! https://73laze.online will be the new domain soon (hopefully) </li>
                    <li> [11.16.25] website name change, this is normal a.d.d. behavior so dont get used to a name lol. </li>
                    <li> [11.07.25] finally fixed the text alignment of the p tags here on this page. when I was trying to fix it I thought I had to change the css in my .home container, but nah. was thinking too hard about it. simple fix. </li>
                    <li> [10.23.25] fixed all the broken links and srcs caused by the transition from publishing from /docs to /root. the repo looks saur gaurd now. </li>
                    <li> [10.23.25] finally cleaned up the directories for the website. I want to actually produce content on this site, but I also want to keep improving its functionality lol. Both are equally time consuming. </li>
                    <li> [10.13.25] have completely overhauled the websites homepage to go into a more minimal direction. quite pleased with out it came out. </li>
                    <li> [10.13.25] deciding to add a static status page to my websites landing page. wanted to use status cafe, but wanted to opt for something simpler.</li>
